## **Data**
This study utilized data from the 2022 General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey designed to track social trends and public opinion in the U.S. The GSS surveys adults aged 18 and older utilizing a full-probability sampling design, ensuring that the dataset reflects the broader U.S. population. In 2022, the GSS employed a combination of face-to-face interviews and probability sampling methods to gather responses. Probability sampling methods—such as stratified random sampling—were used to ensure that every adult in the U.S. had a known and non-zero chance of being selected. This approach helps minimize bias and ensures the sample represents diverse demographic groups, including variations in age, gender, race, and geographic location. The initial sample included 4,149 respondents; however, my dataset consists of only 1,274 cases due to various limitations in the data collection process. 

The reduction in sample size is due to several factors. First, missing data played a role, as some respondents did not answer key questions, making their cases unusable. This could have occurred for several reasons, such as a lack of knowledge on the topic, discomfort with the question, becoming tired due to over-questioning, or simple oversight. Regardless, these cases need to be excluded to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset. Second, the GSS uses a ballot rotation system, in which respondents are assigned to one of three ballots—Ballot A, B, or C. Because not all questions appear on every ballot, some variables—including those used in my study—were only asked to a subset of respondents. In 2022, only Ballots A and C included the variables I examined, which further reduced the sample size. Additionally, certain follow-up questions were only administered to respondents based on their prior answers, further limiting the available data.. Lastly, some individuals selected “Don’t Know” or refused to answer, leading to their exclusion from the final dataset. As such, these factors explain the discrepancy between the total GSS sample and the number of observations in my dataset. 

## **Operationalization**
This study examines the relationship between gun ownership and attitudes toward gun control, specifically whether individuals support or oppose requiring a police permit to purchase a firearm.

To better understand gun regulation, I conceptualized this variable by examining public opinion on requiring a police permit to purchase a gun. I operationalized this variable using the GSS variable gunlaw, which serves as my dependent variable. Respondents were asked: “Would you favor or oppose a law which would require a person to obtain a police permit before he or she could buy a gun?” Respondents could choose between “Favor” or “Oppose.” The mean of this variable (0.73) indicates that a majority of respondents supported requiring a permit for gun purchases. No re-coding was necessary for this variable, as it was already structured to measure attitudes toward gun control.	

As for my independent variable, I examined how personal gun ownership influences attitudes toward gun regulation. I conceptualized this variable by assessing whether individuals have a firearm in their household and operationalized it using the GSS variable owngun. Respondents were asked: “Do you happen to have in your home (IF HOUSE: or garage) any gun or revolvers?” Response options included “Yes” (own a firearm), “No” (do not own a firearm), or “Refused” (declined to answer). The mean of this variable (.33) indicates that approximately one-third of the respondents reported having a gun in their home, with roughly the other two-thirds (.66) not owning one. For my independent variable, I re-coded responses into three categories: has_gun (respondent owns at least one gun), no_gun, (respondent does not own a gun), and refused (respondent declined to answer). This re-coding allows for a clearer cross-tabulation analysis between my variables.

I examined respondents’ political party affiliation as an indicator of their political leanings, which may shape their views on gun regulation. This variable was conceptualized as a measure of political identity and operationalized using GSS items that ask respondents to report their party affiliation and the strength of that identification: “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, Democrat, Independent, or what?” The variable includes responses such as Strong Democrat (mean = 0.18), Not Very Strong Democrat (0.16), Independent Close to Democrat (0.12), Independent (neither, no response; 0.23), Independent Close to Republican (0.08), Not Very Strong Republican (0.10), Strong Republican (0.10), and Other Party (0.04). Each category was dummy-coded (1 = respondent identifies with that category; 0 = otherwise) so that the relationship between political affiliation and support for gun permits can be analyzed more clearly.

To capture the influence of early-life geographic contexts on attitudes toward gun control, I included a variable indicating the region in which respondents lived at age 16. I conceptualized this variable as a marker of formative social and cultural influences and operationalized it using GSS data. Respondents were asked, “In what state or foreign country were you living when you were 16 years old?” The regions are categorized as Foreign (mean = 0.10), New England (0.05), Middle Atlantic (0.10), East North Central (0.15), West North Central (0.06), South Atlantic (0.18), East South Atlantic (0.05), West South Central (0.09), Mountain (0.07), and Pacific (0.14). Each region was dummy-coded (1 = respondent resided in that region; 0 = otherwise). This provided a more nuanced examination of how regional background may relate to support or opposition towards gun control measures.

I further explored respondents’ trust in government by assessing their opinions on government spending towards crime prevention. This variable was operationalized using responses to the question on whether the government is spending too little, about the right amount, or too much on halting the rising crime rate: “We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I'm going to name some of these problems, and for each one I'd like you to name some of these problems, and for each one I'd like you to tell me whether you think we're spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount. First . . . are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on halting the rising crime rate?” The mean values for these responses are: Spending Too Little (0.73), Spending About Right (0.19), and Spending Too Much (0.08). Each response was re-coded into a binary measure (1 = respondent endorses that view; 0 = otherwise), allowing for more straightforward comparisons towards support for gun permit policies.
Lastly, I assessed perceptions of personal safety through a measure of whether respondents are afraid to walk alone at night within a mile of their homes. This variable was conceptualized through neighborhood safety perceptions and operationalized using the relevant GSS item. Respondents were asked: “Is there any area right around here--that is, within a mile--where you would be afraid to walk alone at night?” The responses were coded as Yes (indicating fear; mean = 0.41) and No (indicating no fear; mean = 0.59). The variable was recoded as a dummy variable. (1 = Afraid; 0 = Not Afraid) This more closely examines how safety concerns might intersect with attitudes toward gun control.
